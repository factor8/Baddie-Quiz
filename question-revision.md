# Are You Fumbling A Baddie? -- Question Revision

## Part 1: Analysis of Current Questions

### Question 1: "On a scale of 0-10, how scared are you of falling in love with her?"
**What works:** The slider format is a clever mechanic. It forces honesty through granularity -- there's no hiding behind a witty multiple choice answer. The mapping of "not scared = good" and "terrified = fumbling" is sound logic. If you're terrified of falling for someone you're already dating, you ARE the problem.

**What doesn't work:** The question is solid conceptually but it's doing a lot of emotional heavy lifting as the OPENER. You're asking a man to confront his deepest attachment wound in question one. He hasn't even warmed up yet. Also, the phrasing is almost... tender? For a quiz called "Are You Fumbling A Baddie?" we need the opening to hit like a door being kicked in, not a therapy prompt.

**Verdict:** Keep the concept. Reframe the energy. Move it later in the quiz or rework as a choice question so it lands harder.

### Question 2: "When a bitch be crazy, the right move is:"
**What works:** The voice is PERFECT. This is the tone of the entire quiz distilled into one question. "Let her know she can let it all out" as the right answer is doing important work -- it's testing whether he sees her intensity as something to manage or something to hold space for. The "out-crazy her" option is a great trap for dudes who think matching chaos is the same as supporting someone.

**What doesn't work:** Only three options feels thin. And the question frames her as "crazy" without any context -- is she upset about something real? Is she being chaotic fun? Is she spiraling? The lack of a scenario makes it slightly abstract. A man who's actually fumbling a baddie will rationalize his way out of an abstract question. Give him a scene he can't dodge.

**Verdict:** Keep the spirit. Add a fourth option. Give it just a touch more specificity so the answers reveal more.

---

### Question 3: "She's having a bad day. What's the move?"
**What works:** The answer spread is excellent. The gap between "pull up with a sweet treat" (+5) and "leave her on read" (-10) is appropriately violent. The "damn that's crazy" option at -2 is perfectly calibrated -- it's not evil, it's just lazy, and lazy is its own kind of fumble. This question tests effort, which is really what baddies are evaluating.

**What doesn't work:** It's a little... safe? Every relationship quiz has a version of "she's sad, what do you do?" The question works mechanically but it doesn't capture the SPECIFIC tension of this quiz. She's not just any girl having a bad day. She's a baddie -- maybe her bad day involves a situation that would make an insecure man spiral. Maybe her ex liked her story. Maybe she went out and didn't text back for hours. The "bad day" framing is too generic for the energy we're building.

**Verdict:** Rework the scenario to be more specific to the baddie dynamic. Keep the answer structure.

---

### Question 4: "Be honest -- do you actually see a future with her?"
**What works:** This is the knockout punch and it knows it. "Yeah, and it doesn't scare me to say that" at +10 is the highest-scoring answer in the quiz and it SHOULD be. The "I'm just seeing where it goes (indefinitely)" at -10 is devastating because it's the exact thing men say when they want the benefits of a relationship without the accountability of one. Chef's kiss on that parenthetical.

**What doesn't work:** The original draft had a parenthetical -- "(if she was flexible #change)" -- that got cut. That's interesting because it hints at something the current quiz doesn't address: the men who say they'd commit IF she changed. That's a whole fumble category. The question as-is is strong but it could be even more pointed by acknowledging that some men want a future with a DIFFERENT version of her, and that's worse than not wanting a future at all.

**Verdict:** Keep this question almost exactly. Maybe add an option that captures the "I'd see a future if she toned it down" energy because that is THE fumble this quiz is about.

---

### Question 5: "Do you hate her?"
**What works:** It's funny. The binary is absurd and that absurdity is doing work. It's the palate cleanser after the heavy questions. The scoring is clean: +5 / -5.

**What doesn't work:** It's a throwaway. A quiz this good shouldn't have a throwaway. "Do you hate her" is a question with an obvious right answer, so it's not testing anything real. No one taking this quiz sincerely will click "Yes" unless they're trolling, which means this question doesn't differentiate between "deserves her" and "fumbling." It's dead weight. The concept of checking whether he actually LIKES her is valid, but the execution needs to be sneakier.

**Verdict:** Cut this and replace it with something that tests the same idea -- does he actually enjoy who she IS -- but in a way that reveals something he doesn't realize he's revealing.

## Part 2: Revised Questions

### Question 1: "She posts a thirst trap and it goes viral. Your first thought?"

**Type:** Choice

| Option | Score |
|--------|-------|
| "That's my girl. Everyone can look, I get to touch." | +5 |
| "She's so fine it's actually insane" | +3 |
| "Why does she need that kind of attention?" | -5 |
| "I wouldn't say anything but it would bother me" | -3 |

**What this is really testing:** Can he handle her being publicly desired? This is THE litmus test for dating a baddie. The right answer isn't just tolerance -- it's pride. A man who sees her desirability as a threat instead of a flex is already fumbling. The -3 option is specifically designed to catch the silent seethers -- the men who won't say it out loud but will let it rot inside until it becomes a whole thing.

---

### Question 2: "She tells you she's going out with her girls tonight. No details. What's running through your head?"

**Type:** Choice

| Option | Score |
|--------|-------|
| "Have fun, be safe, call me when you're home if you want" | +5 |
| "Cool, I've got my own plans anyway" | +3 |
| "Where? Who's going? What time will you be back?" | -5 |
| "I don't say anything but I check her location" | -8 |

**What this is really testing:** Trust, ego, and control. A baddie has a life. She had a life before him and she'll have one after if he keeps acting pressed. The +3 answer is important -- it's not as warm as the +5 but it shows a man who has his own identity, which baddies respect. The -5 is the interrogation -- dressing up insecurity as concern. The -8 is the silent surveillance, and it's scored harshly because that behavior is pre-breakup energy and she WILL find out.

---

### Question 3: "When she's going OFF about something -- loud, passionate, maybe a little unhinged -- your move is:"

**Type:** Choice

| Option | Score |
|--------|-------|
| "Let her ride it out. I'm here when the storm passes." | +5 |
| "Match her energy. We're both yelling now. It's kind of fun." | +2 |
| "Try to logic her out of it because she's being 'irrational'" | -5 |
| "Tell her she's overreacting and walk away" | -8 |

**What this is really testing:** Does he pathologize her passion? Baddies are intense. That intensity is what makes them magnetic AND what makes weak men crumble. The +5 answer shows a man who can hold space without trying to manage her. The +2 is chaos-compatible -- not ideal, but at least he's in the arena. The -5 is the classic "rational man vs. emotional woman" framework and it's a fumble every time. The -8 is dismissal plus abandonment, which is a two-for-one fumble special.

---

### Question 4: "Be honest -- do you actually see a future with her?"

**Type:** Choice

| Option | Score |
|--------|-------|
| "Yeah. Her, exactly as she is. That's the girl I want." | +10 |
| "I think so but I'm scared to say it out loud" | +3 |
| "I would if she calmed down a little" | -8 |
| "I'm just seeing where it goes" (it's been 6 months) | -10 |

**What this is really testing:** This is the question the entire quiz has been building to. The +10 answer specifically says "exactly as she is" because that's the whole point. The +3 acknowledges that vulnerability is hard and gives credit for honesty about fear without rewarding avoidance. The -8 is the NEW addition and it's the most important answer in the quiz: "I'd want her if she were less... her." That is the fumble. That's a man who wants a baddie's face and body but not her volume, her opinions, her wildness. He wants the highlight reel without the behind-the-scenes. Coward behavior. The -10 is the eternal situationship -- comfortable enough to stay, uncommitted enough to leave.

---

### Question 5: "What do you actually like about her? Pick the one that's most true."

**Type:** Choice

| Option | Score |
|--------|-------|
| "She's the most interesting person I've ever met" | +5 |
| "She makes me want to be better without even trying" | +5 |
| "She's hot and the sex is crazy" | -2 |
| "I honestly don't know anymore" | -10 |

**What this is really testing:** This replaces "Do you hate her?" but makes it work 100x harder. The two +5 answers both reflect a man who sees her as a full person -- her mind, her effect on him. The -2 isn't scored as harshly because physical attraction matters and we're not pretending otherwise, but if that's THE thing? If that's your best answer? You don't actually like her, you like what she does for your ego. The -10 is devastating because it means he's still there, still taking up her time and energy, and he can't even articulate why. That's not a relationship, that's a hostage situation.

---

### Question 6: "She wants to talk about 'us.' Your honest reaction?"

**Type:** Choice

| Option | Score |
|--------|-------|
| "Good. I have things I want to say too." | +5 |
| "Nervous, but I'm showing up for it" | +3 |
| "Immediately assume it's a trap" | -3 |
| "Pretend I didn't see the text until tomorrow" | -8 |

**What this is really testing:** Emotional availability under pressure. A powerful woman who wants to talk about the relationship is doing something VULNERABLE -- she's leaning in. The +5 answer is a man who meets her there. The +3 is honest about being scared but brave enough to stay. The -3 reveals a man who sees intimacy as a threat, which means he'll never let her get close enough for this to become real. The -8 is avoidance as strategy, and any woman who's dated in the last decade has experienced this exact behavior. It's scored harshly because delay IS the answer -- silence is a sentence.

---

### Question 7 (OPTIONAL SLIDER): "On a scale of 0-10, how much does her intensity scare you?"

**Type:** Slider

| Value | Meaning | Score Mapping |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| 0 | "I signed up for this" | +5 |
| 5 | "Sometimes, yeah" | 0 |
| 10 | "Every single day" | -5 |

**Labels:** Low = "I signed up for this" / High = "Every single day"

**What this is really testing:** This is the reworked version of the original slider question, reframed from "scared of falling in love" to "scared of her intensity." The distinction matters. Fear of love is universal and almost sympathetic. Fear of her INTENSITY is specific -- it means you want her to shrink so you can feel big, and that's not her problem to solve.

---

## Part 3: Revised Scoring Verdicts

**Scoring Range:** With 7 questions, the theoretical range is approximately **-54 to +38**. With 6 questions (dropping the slider), it's **-49 to +33**.

Here's how the verdict tiers map:

### Tier 1: 25-38 points

**Title:** "She Might Actually Keep You"

**Description:** "Against all odds, you might not be delusional. You see her -- actually see her -- and you're not running. That's rare. Don't let this go to your head though. She chose you, which means she can un-choose you. Stay sharp. Woo that woman like you're still trying to get her number."

**Color:** Teal/Green

**Why this works better:** The original "You Might Actually Deserve Her" is good but the revised version flips the power dynamic -- it's not about whether he deserves her, it's about whether she'll keep him. The baddie is always the one with options. He should know that.

---

### Tier 2: 10-24 points

**Title:** "The Fumble Is Loading..."

**Description:** "You're giving just enough to stay in the game but not enough to win. She's noticed the gaps. She's not saying anything yet because she's hoping you'll figure it out -- but she's also mentally drafting the roster of people in her DMs who WOULD figure it out. You have maybe one more season of this behavior before she's gone. The bar is underground and you're still tripping over it."

**Color:** Yellow/Orange

**Why this works better:** The original "You're Slipping" is too gentle. This version makes it visceral -- the DMs detail is specific, funny, and terrifying. The "one more season" framing puts a clock on it without being preachy.

---

### Tier 3: 0-9 points

**Title:** "Fumble in Progress -- All Units Respond"

**Description:** "Sir, the bag is in the air and you're watching it fall in slow motion while checking your fantasy football lineup. She's not asking for the moon. She's asking you to show up, speak up, and act like you actually want to be here. You are currently failing at all three. This is your 'before' era. The question is whether you have an 'after.'"

**Color:** Orange

**Why this works better:** The original "The Fumble Is in Motion" is solid but the expanded version adds the fantasy football detail (specific, funny, painfully relatable) and the "before/after era" framing, which speaks the language of someone who's chronically online -- which is the target audience of this quiz.

---

### Tier 4: Below 0 points

**Title:** "Certified Fumbler -- She's Already Gone"

**Description:** "She's not writing the 'I've been thinking...' text anymore. She wrote it, deleted it, rewrote it, and then decided you don't even deserve an explanation. Her friends have a group chat about you and the name of it would make you cry. She's going to look incredible at the function this weekend and you're going to see the pictures and realize what you had. This isn't a wake-up call. This is the obituary."

**Color:** Red

**Why this works better:** The original is already strong ("Notes app" detail is great) but the revised version escalates: the group chat detail is DEVASTATING because every woman has one and every man fears it. "The obituary" as a closer is dramatic, final, and exactly the energy this quiz lives in. No redemption arc. Just consequences.

## Part 4: Scoring Architecture Notes

### Score Distribution Philosophy

The scoring is intentionally asymmetric -- it's easier to fumble than to succeed. This is by design. The quiz reflects reality: maintaining a relationship with a high-value woman requires consistent, active effort. Coasting IS fumbling.

- **Maximum possible score:** ~38 points (every answer is the best one)
- **Minimum possible score:** ~-54 points (every answer is the worst one)
- **Neutral zone (0-9):** You're not actively terrible but you're not trying either, which IS a fumble, just a slower one

### Why the negative scores hit harder

The worst answers (-8, -10) are scored more harshly than the best answers (+5, +10) because one catastrophic behavior can undo ten good ones. Leaving her on read ONCE doesn't erase six months of showing up -- but checking her location once DOES reveal something that six months of good behavior was covering. The scoring reflects the asymmetry of trust: it's built slowly and destroyed instantly.

### The -8 Sweet Spot

Several "bad but not worst" options are scored at -8 instead of -10. This is intentional. The -10 answers are for men who are overtly checked out. The -8 answers are for men who are COVERTLY checked out -- they're still there, still performing the relationship, but doing things (silent surveillance, strategic avoidance, conditional acceptance) that are arguably worse because they're harder to confront. A man who says "I'm just seeing where it goes" is at least being honest about his ambivalence. A man who checks her location and says nothing is lying to her face every day.

### Question Flow

The questions are ordered intentionally:

1. **Thirst trap** -- Start with something vivid and slightly funny. Low stakes, high reveal.
2. **Girls' night** -- Escalate to trust and control. The scenario is mundane but the answers expose everything.
3. **Going off** -- Test his response to her at full volume. This is where the "can you handle a baddie" rubber meets the road.
4. **Future** -- The emotional climax. This is the question that separates men from boys.
5. **What do you like** -- A deceptively simple question that forces self-reflection.
6. **Talk about us** -- Tests whether he can meet her vulnerability with his own.
7. **Intensity slider** -- Cool-down. Let him sit with a spectrum instead of a binary. The slider gives him room to be honest in a way the choice questions don't, which is why it comes last.

---

## Part 5: Final Notes

### What changed and why

The original quiz is strong in voice but light on specificity. The revised version keeps the same raw, unfiltered tone but grounds every question in a SCENE -- a moment he can picture, a sentence he's actually said, a behavior he's actually done. Abstract questions let men off the hook. Scenarios hold them accountable.

The biggest structural change is replacing "Do you hate her?" with "What do you actually like about her?" -- same diagnostic purpose, completely different level of insight. And adding the "I would if she calmed down a little" option to the future question, because that answer is the THESIS of this entire quiz: you can't want a baddie and also want her to be less of one.

### The thesis, stated plainly

This quiz isn't really asking "are you fumbling her?" It's asking: **"Do you actually want HER, or do you want a version of her that's easier to be with?"** Every question orbits that core tension. The right answers all share one quality: they reflect a man who sees her fully -- the chaos, the volume, the independence, the intensity -- and chose to be there anyway. Not because he's tolerating it. Because he's INTO it.

That's the difference between a man who deserves a baddie and a man who's fumbling one.
